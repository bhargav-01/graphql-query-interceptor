# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor, or use the following approach:

### Using Online Tools:
- Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Upload a simple GraphQL-themed image or logo
- Download the generated icons

### Design Suggestions:
- Use purple/blue gradient colors (matching the extension theme)
- Include "GQL" text or GraphQL logo
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

### Temporary Placeholder:
Until proper icons are created, you can use solid color PNG files with the extension name or initials.

## Note:
The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon instead.
